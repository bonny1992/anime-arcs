# Anime Arcs
A repository that acts as a database for anime episode arcs.

Basically the idea of this repository is to be of use for apps that require a centralized database of anime arcs.

Fundamentally when it will contain more entries, it will be a matter of just doing:
```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bonny1992/anime-arcs/refs/heads/main/animes/J/Jujutsu%20Kaisen%20(2020)/arcs.yml
```
to obtain of the info needed.
